# Hobbies

## Music ~ Piano

<br>Music, particularly playing the piano, offers numerous benefits that enhance both mental and emotional well-being. It fosters creativity, improves cognitive function, and strengthens memory by requiring the coordination of both hands and the brain. The act of playing the piano can serve as a powerful form of stress relief, providing an emotional outlet and promoting relaxation. It also helps to cultivate discipline and patience, as mastering the instrument involves consistent practice and dedication. Moreover, music has been shown to improve mood, reduce anxiety, and enhance emotional expression, making it an invaluable tool for personal growth and life satisfaction. In addition, the ability to play an instrument can bring joy to others, creating a sense of connection and community. Whether as a form of self-expression or as a way to unwind, playing the piano contributes to a balanced and fulfilling life.

## Theater Group

<br>Joining a theater group not only enhances acting skills but also significantly enriches one's life experience. Through rehearsals and performances, we learn how to collaborate and communicate effectively within a team, and how to better understand human nature and emotions through different roles. This immersive form of expression boosts self-confidence, improves public speaking abilities, and provides an excellent outlet for stress relief and relaxation. The emotional investment and creative process in theater not only reflect an artistic pursuit but also contribute to personal expression and self-awareness. More importantly, a theater group fosters a community full of creativity and interaction, allowing us to meet like-minded individuals, expand our perspectives, and cultivate teamwork and a sense of collective responsibility. Whether as an audience member or an actor, participating in a theater group makes life more vibrant and brings greater enthusiasm and energy into our daily experiences, while deepening our understanding of society and interpersonal relationships.
